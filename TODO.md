# Receipt OCR Fix - TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze the server.js parse-receipt endpoint
- [x] Identify that OCR processing was failing due to Document AI errors causing fallback to Vision API
- [x] Refactor OCR logic to try both Vision API and Document AI in parallel
- [x] Prioritize Vision API for reliable text extraction
- [x] Use Document AI for structured line items when available
- [x] Fall back to rule-based parsing from OCR text if no structured data
- [x] Ensure consistent response format with text, entities, lineItems, and confidence
- [x] Start the backend server successfully

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the receipt scanning functionality with sample images
- [ ] Verify that OCR text is extracted properly
- [ ] Confirm that line items are parsed correctly from the text
- [ ] Check that categorization works for the parsed items
- [ ] Deploy and test in production environment if needed
